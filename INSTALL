Prerequisites:

You'll need to have these libraries with equivalent development versions to 
build the Anura engine:

 boost_iostreams >= 1.50.0
 boost_filesystem >= 1.50.0
 boost_regex >= 1.50.0
 boost_asio >= 1.50.0
 boost_system >= 1.50.0
 libsdl >= 2.0.0
 libsdl-image >= 2.0.0 (with png support)
 libsdl-mixer >= 2.0.0 (with Vorbis support)
 libsdl-ttf >= 2.0.12
 glm
 gl
 glew
 libz
 
Building:

It is recommended to install the program 'ccache' as this can considerably
speed up build times for subsequent builds. This is however not required.
To build, type 'make'. The Makefile will probably work. :) If it doesn't you 
may have to tweak it for your platform. The executable 'anura' will be 
created which you can run.

To access the level editor, press CTRL-E during the game.

Have fun!


Building on Ubuntu 13.10
------------------------

The following are some specific instructions for setting up the prequisites for anura on Ubuntu 13.10

sudo apt-get install build-essential ccache git libglm-dev libboost1.53-all-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libfreetype6-dev mercurial autoconf libglew-dev libpng12-dev liblua5.2-dev
hg clone http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL_ttf
cd SDL_ttf
hg update "release-2.0.12"
./autogen.sh
mkdir build && cd build
../configure && make && sudo make install
