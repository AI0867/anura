Prerequisites:

You'll need to have these libraries with equivalent development versions to 
build the Anura engine:

 boost_iostreams >= 1.50.0
 boost_filesystem >= 1.50.0
 boost_regex >= 1.50.0
 boost_asio >= 1.50.0
 boost_system >= 1.50.0
 libsdl >= 2.0.0
 libsdl-image >= 2.0.0 (with png support)
 libsdl-mixer >= 2.0.0 (with Vorbis support)
 libsdl-ttf >= 2.0.12
 glm
 gl
 glew
 libz
 
Building:

It is recommended to install the program 'ccache' as this can considerably
speed up build times for subsequent builds. This is however not required.
To build, type 'make'. The Makefile will probably work. :) If it doesn't you 
may have to tweak it for your platform. The executable 'anura' will be 
created which you can run.

To access the level editor, press CTRL-E during the game.

Have fun!
